# HTLN-fish-cecr

R and Python scripts to look at the relationships between climate exposure, 
fish habitat, and fish community response in HTLN rivers and streams.

# Notes

    Task list:

    (1) pull data from USGS gauge stations and climate analyzer APIs
    
    (2) start looking at level and discharge data
    
    (3) what are park thresholds for flooding at BUFF and OZAR?
    
    (4) Are there detectable signals for flooding and drought in hydrographs
