# HTLN-fish-cecr

R and Python scripts to (1) pull data from climate exposure APIs, (2) transform climate data
for sensitivity analysis, (3) transform and visualize fish community and habitat data, 
(4) run preliminary correlation analyses of fish populations and fish habitat data against various
climate exposure factors, and (5) develop regression models to look at the
relationships between climate exposure, fish habitat, and fish
community response in HTLN rivers and streams.
